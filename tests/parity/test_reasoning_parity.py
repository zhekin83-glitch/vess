"""Real parity tests for the v2 ReasoningEngine vs the legacy class.

The continuation plan section 0.2 calls out the
**facade-self-equivalence false positive**: any v2 module that
merely re-exports its v1 counterpart would trivially "pass" parity
checks. To pin a true rewrite, these tests assert two invariants
across ten representative inputs (six Decision kinds and four
guard-evaluation contexts):

1. ``inspect.getfile(...)`` of the v1 and v2 ``ReasoningEngine``
   classes points at **different** files (the new
   ``openakita.agent.reasoning`` module and the renamed
   ``openakita.core._reasoning_runtime`` module
   respectively).
2. For each fixture under ``tests/parity/fixtures/reasoning/``,
   the decision-routing label and the guard-verdict summary
   produced by the v2 engine match the legacy outputs.

The fixtures live under :data:`FIXTURE_DIR` as plain JSON so they
double as a regression corpus: any future change to a guard or to
the routing table is caught by a fixture mismatch instead of an
opaque integration test failure.
