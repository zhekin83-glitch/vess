"""Syntax-guard test pinning the ``except ValueError: state.status = X``
force-write pattern population (plan §5.6 / v1.28.3-pre S5-A audit).

Why this exists
---------------
The v1.27.13 hotfix (06c67221) and historical reason_stream code carry
**8** ``except ValueError: state.status = TaskStatus.X`` force-write
blocks (in ``_reasoning_runtime.py`` post ADR-0003 split) that
paper over the ``completed -> reasoning`` (and similar) race exposed by
issue #572.  Post v1.28 S1+S3+S4+S5-A the
underlying race is architecturally prevented at the
``ConversationLifecycleManager`` entry, so these force-writes should be
unreachable in practice — but we cannot delete them until production
``inc_illegal_reasoning_entry`` telemetry confirms 2 weeks of zero hits
(see release-notes/v1.28.md "Stage 5-A" + "Audit findings").

This test enforces three invariants:

1. **No new force-write may be added without explicit opt-in.**
   Each existing force-write carries an inline ``# s5b-allow-force-write``
   token within ±5 lines of its ``except ValueError:`` keyword.
   A new force-write added without the token fails this test —
   contributors must explicitly acknowledge they're growing the
   S5-B backlog.

2. **No force-write may be added in *other* files.**
   Today every force-write lives in ``reasoning_engine.py``.  If
   ``agent_state.py``, ``agent.py``, ``ralph.py``, etc. grow a new
   force-write, the test fails — concentrating the debt makes
   S5-B's deletion mechanically tractable.

3. **The total count is pinned.**
   When S5-B lands, it deletes the force-writes and drops the
   expected count to 0.  Any drift in the interim (accidental
   delete by an unrelated refactor / accidental add by a hot-fix)
   triggers a precise diff in the failure message.

What counts as a "force-write"
------------------------------
An ``except ValueError`` handler that contains an ``Assign`` to
``state.status`` or ``self.status`` anywhere in its body.  The
status value can be a simple name (``TaskStatus.FOO``), a
conditional expression, or another expression — what matters is
that an assignment to ``.status`` bypasses ``transition()``.

# Two kinds of force-write are recognised, distinguished by inline

#
#   • ``s5b-allow-force-write`` — historical hot-fix / safety-net debt
#     that S5-B will delete after 2 weeks of zero
#     ``inc_illegal_reasoning_entry`` telemetry.  Lives only in
#     ``_reasoning_runtime.py``.  Pinned at exactly 8 occurrences.
#
#   • ``cancel-idempotent-force-write`` — ``TaskState.cancel()``'s
#     architecturally-permanent escape hatch.  cancel() MUST succeed
