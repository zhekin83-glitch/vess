"""C15 §17.1 — Evolution self-fix audit window (R4-9).

Motivation
==========

``evolution.self_check._attempt_fix`` spawns a fresh agent and lets it
run mostly-arbitrary tool calls under a strict prompt. Two problems:

1. Pre-C14, that agent inherited the *parent's* PolicyContext —
   which for most channels means ``is_unattended=False``, so any
   CONFIRM-class tool would hang waiting for a UI response that
   never came (C14 follow-up gap).
2. The fix agent's tool calls were not differentiable from the
   parent agent's tool calls in the audit log, so operators had no
   way to retrospectively answer "what did Evolution try to change
   last night?".

This module solves (2): it carries a stable ``fix_id`` through the
PolicyContext for the duration of the fix attempt, and exposes a
hook the engine uses to append every decision made during the
window to ``data/audit/evolution_decisions.jsonl``.

(1) is solved by the caller wiring
``classify_entry("evolution", force_unattended=True)`` →
``build_policy_context(...)`` → ``set_current_context`` around the
``agent.chat`` call — see ``evolution.self_check._attempt_fix``.

What this module does NOT do
============================

We deliberately do **not** relax ``safety_immune`` during the
window. The plan (§17.1) mentions a "time-window exception" but
implementing it without a careful threat model is risky:

- Evolution writing to ``identity/runtime/**`` could rewrite the
  agent's own personality permissions.
- Evolution writing to ``data/audit/**`` could rewrite history.

Phase C v1 keeps the existing safety_immune DENY behavior for those
paths. The audit trail this module produces is the foundation for a
future commit that, with operator opt-in, can add **explicit, narrow**
exemption rules (e.g. "allow rewriting ``identity/runtime/cache/``
during an active evolution window only").

State model
===========

Two pieces of state are tracked:

- A process-wide ``contextvars.ContextVar`` of the *active* fix id,
  set by ``self_check`` via :func:`set_active_fix_id` /
  :func:`reset_active_fix_id` (the same wrapper pattern as
  :func:`policy_v2.set_current_context`). This lets nested helpers
  inside the fix agent read the current id without explicit
  threading.

- A short-lived in-memory window dict (``_WINDOWS``) keyed by
  fix_id with the open/close timestamps and reason. Used purely for
  audit serialisation (deadline checks, duration measurement); it
  is **not** consulted by the policy decision path.

The window is bounded by an absolute deadline (default 600s) so a
crashed ``_attempt_fix`` cannot leave a stale window open and lure
later decisions into evolution-marked audit records.
