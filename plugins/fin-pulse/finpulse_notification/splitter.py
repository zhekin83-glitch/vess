"""Line-boundary content splitter.

Host IM adapters do **not** auto-chunk long messages; a 25 KB digest
silently gets truncated by Feishu / DingTalk. We therefore split the
markdown blob along ``\\n`` boundaries so no line is ever cut in the
middle (which would leave half-rendered links / orphan scores / etc).

The algorithm is intentionally conservative, with two small hardenings:

* Each chunk emitted **after the first** is prefixed with the caller's
  ``base_header`` (e.g. ``"[早报 续 2/3]\n"``) so recipients can tell
  a mid-stream chunk apart from a fresh push.
* A lone over-sized line (``len(line) > max_bytes``) becomes its own
  chunk (force-split) rather than being dropped — we never silently
  eat content.
