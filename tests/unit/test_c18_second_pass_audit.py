"""C18 二轮自审修复 —— bug-by-bug regression coverage.

After shipping Phase A..D + F we self-reviewed and found 4 real
issues. This file owns the regression tests so future refactors can't
silently re-break them.

1. **BUG-A1**: ``PolicyHotReloader._do_reload`` reported ``ok=True``
   for an invalid YAML reload when LKG was ``None`` at the time of the
   reload attempt — because the "LKG didn't change" check only fires
   for "LKG was set BEFORE and didn't advance". When LKG was never set
   (process started with broken YAML), an invalid edit silently looked
   like success.

2. **BUG-C1**: ``audit_logger._global_audit`` is a process-wide
   singleton; ``get_audit_logger()`` caches its first construction.
   Hot-reload or ``OPENAKITA_AUDIT_LOG_PATH`` could change
   ``audit.log_path`` in ``_config`` but subsequent audit writes still
   went to the original file. ``rebuild_engine_v2`` now resets the
   singleton when any audit field changes.

3. **BUG-C2** (latent deadlock): ``_audit_env_overrides`` was called
   from inside ``rebuild_engine_v2``'s ``_lock`` scope. When
   ``_global_audit is None`` (e.g. after ``reset_audit_logger`` from
   BUG-C1 fix), ``get_audit_logger()`` would re-enter
   ``get_config_v2()`` which also tries to acquire ``_lock``. Lock is
   ``threading.Lock`` (non-reentrant) → process deadlock. Fix: pass
   ``cfg`` directly so the function constructs an ephemeral
   AuditLogger without singleton/lock re-entry.

4. **IMPROVEMENT-B1** (frontend, not Python-testable here): the batch
   resolve callback now checks ``r.ok`` + JSON ``status`` before
   clearing the local queue. Covered by manual smoke test +
   ``scripts/c18_audit.py`` checking the conditional is present in
   ChatView.tsx.
