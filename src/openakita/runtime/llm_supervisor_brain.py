"""RC-5 route-B prototype: an LLM-driven :class:`SupervisorBrain` (dry-run).

Why this file exists
--------------------
The dual-ledger :class:`~openakita.runtime.supervisor.Supervisor` skeleton
(outer/inner loop, :class:`~openakita.runtime.stall_detector.StallDetector`,
replan, per-turn checkpoint) is complete and correct, but the only brains
that satisfy its protocol are the *scaffold* brains in
``openakita.agent.supervisor_brain`` (``Degenerate`` / ``PassThrough``),
both of which terminate on turn 2 and therefore never drive stall / replan.
The real Magentic-One style orchestration brain was the never-delivered
``P-RC-4`` follow-up (see ``_rc5_biz/rc5_rca_report.md``).

This module is the **route-B prototype** answering the pathfinding question
*"is the skeleton actually ready, and only the brain missing?"*. It is a
deliberately **dry-run** implementation: enough to drive the loop across
multiple turns and trip stall / replan / checkpoint, not a production-grade
orchestrator.

⚠️ Two-protocol trap (RC-5 §2)
------------------------------
There are **two** unrelated protocols named ``SupervisorBrain``:

* ``openakita.runtime.supervisor.SupervisorBrain`` -- the *orchestration*
  protocol the :class:`Supervisor` actually depends on:
  ``extract_facts`` / ``draft_plan`` / ``emit_progress_ledger``.
* ``openakita.agent.brain`` -- a *gateway* protocol (``think_lightweight`` /
  ``get_current_endpoint_info``) used for plain LLM calls. The real
  LLM-backed ``Brain`` implements *that* one and is **not** plug-compatible
  with the Supervisor.

To avoid the trap, this brain implements the *orchestration* protocol and
talks to the LLM through a narrow, injectable :class:`SupervisorLLMClient`
seam (see below). Mock tests inject a fake client; the live phase injects an
adapter over the real gateway ``Brain``. The Supervisor never knows which.

Dry-run simplifications (intentional, RC-5 Phase B)
---------------------------------------------------
* ``next_speaker`` address resolution is *best-effort*: when a node
  directory is supplied we normalise a role-style answer to a concrete
  ``node_id`` via :meth:`LLMSupervisorBrain.resolve_next_speaker`; on any
  ambiguity we leave the model's answer untouched and let the Supervisor's
  existing 10x JSON-retry path own correctness. A complete role/address
  resolver is the next-phase gap (#2).
* The three orchestrator prompts are adapted from AutoGen Magentic-One
  ``_prompts.py`` (see ``_rc5_biz/prototype/prompts/``) but otherwise kept
  short; cheap-model tiering is deferred to the live phase.

# (2) three explicit convergence Decision rules so a *sighted* brain finishes

# no-progress / loop when the nodes spin -- instead of optimistically reporting
# progress=true/satisfied=false forever until the hard turn cap.
#
# The "reasoning, then PURE JSON" wording is kept tight to reduce thinking-mode

ORCHESTRATOR_PROGRESS_LEDGER_PROMPT = """Recall the request we are working on:

{task}

The organization of nodes available to address it:

{team}

Plan we are following:

{plan}

Your own past progress assessments (most recent last):

{history}

=== ACTUAL OUTPUTS produced by the nodes so far (most recent last) ===
These are the REAL deliverables each node has returned. Judge progress and
satisfaction from THESE concrete outputs, not from optimism about future work.
IMPORTANT: every node you delegate to ALSO receives these same upstream
outputs inlined in its instruction. So a node has no excuse to claim "I don't
see the data / the file is missing / please paste it again" -- the content is
right there in front of it.

{outputs}
=== end of actual outputs ===

Decision rules (follow strictly):
- is_request_satisfied = true when the actual outputs above ALREADY cover the
  substantive parts of the request well enough to hand back to the user. Aim
  for a useful, good-enough deliverable -- do NOT hold out for an idealised
  perfect version or keep delegating polish/busywork once the core ask is met.
  When in doubt and the outputs already contain a concrete, usable result,
  prefer finishing.
- If a node's latest output is mostly a refusal / a complaint about missing
  context / a request for the user to re-paste data that is ALREADY shown in
  the outputs above, treat that as a node-side failure, NOT a real blocker:
  set is_in_loop = true and either (a) re-instruct the SAME node to use the
  inlined upstream outputs directly and produce the concrete deliverable now,
  or (b) route to a different, more capable node. Do NOT keep repeating the
  identical instruction to a node that is stuck.
- If the request is impossible, self-contradictory, or under-specified such
  that no output can ever satisfy it, set is_progress_being_made = false and
  explain why in the reason; do NOT pretend optimistic progress.
- If the latest outputs add no real improvement over earlier ones (the nodes
  are spinning / repeating without resolving the request), set
  is_progress_being_made = false and/or is_in_loop = true so we can replan or
  stop, instead of looping until a hard turn cap.
- Otherwise, route the single most useful next step. (next_speaker must be one
  of: {names})
- RESPECT THE ORG CHART — 逐级派发, 逐级汇报. The team block above shows each
  node's links (可下派给 / 汇报回 / 可协作). You (the central orchestrator) only
  address the root/主编 node and its DIRECT reports; you do NOT reach deep/leaf
  nodes yourself. Route ALONG the structure, never teleport work:
  * The first turn must go to the root/主编 (入口). The root splits the task and
    delegates to ITS direct reports; each report that itself has reports will in
    turn delegate DOWN to its own reports and integrate their results back UP —
    this multi-level cascade happens automatically inside one delegation, so a
    single route to the root can drive the whole tree.
  * Prefer routing to the root and letting it cascade. Only route to one of the
    root's direct reports when the root explicitly needs that specific report to
    act and has not already cascaded to it.
  * Never start with, or jump to, a leaf specialist — deeper levels are reached
    only via their own parent's delegation, not by you.
  * INTEGRATION / FINAL SYNTHESIS IS THE ROOT'S JOB. The closing step — merging
    all upstream outputs into ONE integrated deliverable and writing the final
    summary/report — MUST be routed to the root/主编 node, never to one of its
    reports (a 策划/编辑/分析 report may draft its own part, but it must NOT be the
    one that produces the whole-task integrated deliverable). If the upstream
    reports have all delivered but the root has NOT yet produced an integrated
    result that covers the whole request, then: set is_request_satisfied=false
    and route next_speaker to the ROOT so it integrates and delivers. Do NOT set
    is_request_satisfied=true, and do NOT route the integration to a report node,
    just because the reports finished their pieces.
  * Only set is_request_satisfied=true once the ROOT itself has produced the
    integrated result that covers the request (not merely a kickoff / 派单 /
    项目启动 note). The root's first output is usually a kickoff that splits the
    work — that is NOT the final deliverable; keep going until the root has
    integrated the reports' outputs.
  * Set execution_phase="planning" when the selected coordinator should only
    decompose the task and declare a structured delegation DAG. Use
    execution_phase="execution" when the selected node must invoke its own
    business/file tools or perform review/rework. Set execution_phase=
    "finalization" only for the closing ROOT integration turn.
  This keeps the flow legible: 主编 拆分 → 按连线逐级派给下游 → 下游逐级回流 →
  主编整合汇报，直到满足请求。

Answer with brief reasoning, then output PURE JSON matching this exact schema,
parsable as-is, with NOTHING else after it:

        "is_request_satisfied":    {{"answer": boolean, "reason": string}},
