"""FastAPI middleware that enforces the first-run Setup flow.

When OpenAkita is reachable on the LAN but no web-access password has been
configured yet, **non-loopback** API callers must complete the Setup flow
before any other endpoint will respond. This prevents the "anyone on the
LAN can call internal APIs on a fresh install" footgun that used to be
hidden by the auto-generated password (printed to logs once and then
forgotten).

Decision delegated to :mod:`openakita.api.setup_state`. This module only
owns the path allowlist and the HTTP envelope of the gate response.

Ordering note: register this middleware so it runs *before*
:func:`openakita.api.auth.create_auth_middleware`. With FastAPI's LIFO
middleware stack, that means *add it last*. The auth middleware would
otherwise issue a 401 first, hiding the actionable 428 from the frontend.
