"""C23 P2-3: ChatView consumes ``tool_intent_preview`` SSE.

Background
==========

C9c-1 added the backend ``tool_intent_preview`` SSE emission in
``tool_executor._emit_tool_intent_previews`` so the UI can hint at
"engine is about to call X" before any tool actually runs. But from
C9c-1 to C20 the *frontend* never subscribed — the event got emitted,
serialized over WebSocket, and dropped on the floor.

C21 二轮架构审计标 P2-3. C23 wires ChatView to handle the event by
showing a 2.5s toast for non-readonly tools.

This test
=========

Pure structural grep guard — frontend has no Jest / Vitest harness in
this repo. We assert:

1. The chat event union type knows about ``tool_intent_preview``
2. ChatView has a ``case "tool_intent_preview":`` handler in its
   stream-event switch
3. The handler imports ``toast`` from sonner
4. The i18n strings exist in zh + en

Any future refactor that breaks one of these gets flagged immediately
without needing a JS runtime.
