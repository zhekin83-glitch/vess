"""C16 Phase C — Tamper-evident JSONL audit chain.

Replaces plain ``open(path, "a")`` audit writers across the policy_v2
surface with ``ChainedJsonlWriter``: each record carries ``prev_hash`` and
``row_hash``, computed as SHA-256 over the canonical JSON of the record
(``row_hash`` excluded from its own input). Tampering with any past row
breaks the chain at that exact line, detectable via ``verify_chain``.

Design constraints
------------------

* Single-writer-per-file (per process). A process-level
  ``threading.Lock`` plus a singleton-per-path map (``_WRITERS``) keeps
  intra-process appends consistent.
* **C17 Phase E.1**: ``filelock.FileLock`` now provides cross-process
  serialization. Each ``append()`` acquires the filelock, re-reads the
  last row_hash from disk (since a sibling process may have appended in
  the gap between our last write and now), enriches the new row, writes,
  and releases. The lock file lives next to the JSONL with ``.lock``
  suffix. When ``filelock`` is unavailable, a small stdlib OS file-lock
  fallback preserves the same cross-process serialization contract.
* Crash recovery: if the previous run died mid-write, the file may end on
  a partial JSON line. ``ChainedJsonlWriter`` detects this on open,
  truncates the partial bytes (only when the file does *not* end in
  newline), warns, and resumes from the last full line.
* Legacy prefix: existing audit files written before C16 lack
  ``row_hash``. The writer bootstraps from ``GENESIS_HASH`` at first
  append; ``verify_chain`` reports the legacy prefix length separately
  from tamper events.
* Deterministic serialization: ``json.dumps(sort_keys=True,
  separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False)``. ``ts`` is a float —
  CPython's ``repr(float)`` is deterministic across 3.1+, so re-hashing
  on read matches the stored ``row_hash``.
* Fail-closed on tamper from the *reader*'s perspective: ``verify_chain``
  returns ``ok=False`` and the offending line index; the writer keeps
  appending so the audit never stops collecting evidence, but the
  verifier surfaces "this file is no longer trustworthy".

C17 二轮 audit tail-window 修复
-------------------------------

The original C17 code used a fixed 64 KB tail window for both
``_bootstrap`` and ``_reload_last_hash_from_disk``. If a single audit row
exceeds that (realistic for ``ParamMutationAuditor`` writes carrying
large ``before``/``after`` payloads, even after ``_sanitize_for_chain``
truncates strings), the tail read would land in the middle of a row and
:func:`_reload_last_hash_from_disk` would silently fail to update
``_last_hash`` — meaning the *next* append would chain off a stale hash
and produce a verify_chain mismatch. We now scan backwards in doubling
chunks via :func:`_read_last_complete_line` up to a 16 MiB hard cap, so
any reasonable single record is recoverable while pathological lines
(>16 MiB) degrade explicitly rather than corrupting the chain.

C20 — JSONL rotation
--------------------

The writer optionally rolls the active file aside on each ``append()``
based on :class:`AuditConfig.rotation_mode`:

* ``"none"`` (default): never rotate; behaviour identical to C16/C17/C18.
* ``"daily"``: when the active file's mtime falls on a UTC date that
  differs from "today", rename the active file to
  ``<stem>.YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`` (date = mtime's UTC date) before writing
  the new record.
* ``"size"``: when ``stat().st_size + len(serialized_line) >
  rotation_size_mb * 1024 * 1024``, rename the active file to
  ``<stem>.YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.jsonl`` (UTC timestamp at rotation moment)
  before writing.

**Chain head carry-over** (the contract the original C16 docstring
deferred to "when rotation lands"): because rotation happens *inside*
the same ``with self._lock`` + filelock scope as the append, and because
we always ``_reload_last_hash_from_disk()`` BEFORE deciding to rotate,
the writer's in-memory ``_last_hash`` already points at the renamed
file's tail row_hash when we open the (now-empty) new file for write.
The first record written to the new file therefore has
``prev_hash = <last row_hash of the rotated file>`` — a verifier walking
``<stem>.YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`` → ``<stem>.jsonl`` in mtime order sees one
continuous chain.

Rotation never widens the trust boundary: it's all under the same
process+filelock window as appends, and ``self.path`` (the *active*
file) is unchanged by rotation — only its on-disk content is moved
aside, so callers don't need to re-resolve the writer.

Pruning: after rotation, if ``rotation_keep_count > 0``, archives
matching ``<stem>.*.jsonl`` are sorted by mtime ascending and the
oldest beyond the keep window are unlinked. ``keep_count = 0`` =
unlimited (operator runs an external archiver).

Out of scope (explicit follow-ups, not bugs)
---------------------------------------------

* ``ParamMutationAuditor`` (C17 Phase E.2) uses the same
  ``ChainedJsonlWriter`` infrastructure — so it inherits rotation
  automatically once its ``AuditConfig`` is wired the same way.
* Cross-process clock skew for daily mode: we use ``time.time()`` of
  *this* process for "today", and ``Path.stat().st_mtime`` of the file
  for "last write". If two processes on different timezones / clocks
  share the file, the date comparison may flip-flop near midnight UTC.
  Operators running multi-host audit consolidation should keep clocks
  in sync via NTP (which is the assumption everywhere else in OpenAkita
  too).

        Plan §13.5.2 A specified an async batch writer to coalesce audit
        writes. Per-record :meth:`append` re-acquires the cross-process
        filelock + re-reads the tail every call (~ms each). Under
        burst load (e.g. checkpoint replay) this dominates engine
        latency. ``append_batch`` keeps the same correctness guarantees
        but pays the filelock + tail-read cost once for the whole batch:

        - Acquire process lock + filelock once
        - Re-read tail once to refresh ``_last_hash``
        - For each record: compute prev_hash → row_hash in-memory,
          chaining the next record off the previous in-batch row_hash
          (NOT off the on-disk tail — the next on-disk tail will be
          the *previous* in-batch row after we write)
        - Pre-build all enriched lines, then a single ``fh.write`` of
          the concatenated lines + optional fsync
        - Update ``_last_hash`` to the last in-batch row_hash
        - Release locks

        Chain invariant: external verifier sees exactly the same byte
        sequence as if N :meth:`append` calls had been made
        back-to-back. Empty list → no-op, returns ``[]``.

        Returns the list of enriched records (in input order). On
