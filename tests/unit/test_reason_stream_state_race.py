"""Regression: race between two requests on the same conversation_id can push
the shared ``TaskState`` into a terminal status (COMPLETED / FAILED / CANCELLED)
while another ``reason_stream`` iteration is mid-loop. The unprotected
``state.transition(TaskStatus.REASONING)`` at the top of the stream loop would
then raise ``ValueError`` and tear down the SSE stream — exactly the crash
reported in issue #572 ("[Bug] 执行任务系统直接爆炸") whose diagnostic ZIP
shows::

    ERROR - reason_stream error: 非法状态转换: completed -> reasoning.
            合法目标: ['idle', 'cancelled']

These tests pin the contract that:

1. The state machine itself **does** reject the bad transition (so the runtime
   knows there is a race);
2. ``reason_stream`` and ``_switch_model_for_stream`` both wrap their
   ``transition(...)`` calls with ``try/except ValueError`` so a concurrent
   terminal status never crashes the stream.

The check uses ``inspect.getsource`` instead of running the full ``reason_stream``
coroutine — that coroutine has dozens of external dependencies (brain,
tool_executor, supervisor, budget, context manager …) which would make the
mock surface fragile and unrelated to this specific contract.
