"""Sentinel #9 -- v1 orgs source surface retired (P-RC-9 P9.9eta-1).

Ninth P-RC-9 sentinel; joins the 6 parity slots
(P9.1c..P9.6gamma) + 7th REST contract sentinel
(``test_rest_contract_sentinel.py``; P9.7gamma-2) + 8th
frontend stale-path sentinel
(``test_frontend_stale_paths_sentinel.py``; P9.8delta-1) as
another **active** (non-xfail) collection-time invariant. Locks
in the two invariants P-RC-9 P9.9epsilon established by
physically retiring the v1 src surface:

* P9.9epsilon-2a (``857a5a35``) -- ``git rm`` on
  ``src/openakita/api/routes/orgs.py`` (-2 533 LOC; 89 v1
  endpoints) + 2 dev scripts + OpenAPI snapshot regen.
* P9.9epsilon-2b (``90a7d77f``) -- atomic
  ``git rm -r src/openakita/orgs/`` (-20 237 LOC; 26 files);
  largest single deletion of P-RC-9.

Two invariants (P-RC-10 P10.4 reverses Test 2 polarity; P10.6
tightens Test 2 further -- see Test 2 docstring for the
post-shim-removal reality):

1. **v1 src directory retired (Option-Z augmented at P10.2)** --
   ``src/openakita/orgs/`` is either gone (original P-RC-9
   state) or hosts the post-P10.1 v2 flatten (structural
   markers required; v1 regrowth still blocked).

2. **production sources are LEGACY-import-free (post-P10.6)**
   -- strict regex ``^\\s*(?:from|import)\\s+openakita\\.runtime\\.orgs(?:\\.|$|\\s)``
   MUST find zero hits under ``src/openakita/``, with NO
   whitelist. P10.6 (``git rm``) removed the lone P10.2
   deprecation shim file at
   ``src/openakita/runtime/orgs/__init__.py`` and the
   companion directory; the whitelist tuple has been dropped
   (was length 1). Test 2 additionally asserts that the
   ``src/openakita/runtime/orgs/`` directory itself no longer
   exists -- a hard post-removal invariant.

Charter cross-refs:

* ``docs/revamp/P-RC-9-P9.9-CHARTER.md`` sec 5.7 (eta-1
  outlook + 9th sentinel adoption) and sec 7.2 (sentinel
  rationale; ADR-0011 Protocol-ceiling unaffected; recommend
  ADOPT (Y)).
* ``docs/revamp/P-RC-9-P9.9-eps-CHARTER.md`` sec 0 + sec 8
  (eta-1 hand-off sequence).
* ``docs/revamp/P-RC-9-P9.9-eps-AUDIT.md`` sec 2.1 (audited
  docstring back-references that the strict regex correctly
  exempts).
* ``docs/revamp/P-RC-10-CHARTER.md`` sec 3 P10.4 + RECON sec 4
  (polarity flip after P10.1 flatten) + sec 2 P10.6 (shim
  removal trigger conditions and post-removal directory
  invariant).

The sentinel does **not** activate via ``@pytest.mark.xfail``
-- in the P9.x convention "sentinel" means **active
assertion**; xfail markers are removed when the invariant is
met (which is now, post-epsilon-2b, post-P10.4 and
post-P10.6).
