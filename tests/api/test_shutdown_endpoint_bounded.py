"""Sprint 14 / v31 Phase A + Sprint 15 / v32 Phase B regression:
``POST /api/shutdown`` must return immediately AND arm an ``os._exit(0)``
safety net so a wedged graceful path can no longer pin the process for
13~20 s.

Forensic background — see ``_v31_biz_e2e/_phase_a_post_fix_forensics.md``
and ``_v32_biz/_phase_b_watchdog_redesign.md``:

* v23/v24/v26/v28/v29/v30 reproduced ``POST /api/shutdown`` returning
  200 but the process never self-exiting in time, forcing a manual
  ``Stop-Process`` every regression.
* v31 added an ``asyncio.create_task`` watchdog; it ARMED in 4/4 runs
  but FIRED in 0/4 because uvicorn lifespan teardown cancels every
  pending asyncio task.
* v32 (this commit) replaces the watchdog with ``threading.Timer``
  which has no asyncio handle and survives lifespan teardown.

These tests pin three route-level guarantees:

1. ``POST /api/shutdown`` returns 200 ``shutting_down`` quickly.
2. The route arms the force-exit watchdog (visible on ``app.state``).
3. ``shutdown_force_exit_grace_s = 0`` disables the safety net.

Threading vs. legacy-asyncio mechanism-level tests live in
``test_force_exit_watchdog_threading.py`` so this file stays focused on
the HTTP route contract.

    """A real FastAPI app with a fresh ``shutdown_event`` wired in.

    The ``app.state.shutdown_event`` must exist for the force-exit safety
    net to arm; ``create_app(...)`` accepts it as a kwarg.

    Three access gates need satisfying for the TestClient to reach the
    handler:

    1. The setup gate: proxied requests are intentionally not trusted as
       local, so the fixture completes setup in an isolated data directory.
    2. The auth middleware: TestClient's host is ``testclient`` (not
       ``127.0.0.1``) so we mint a real access token, mirroring how the
       desktop GUI authenticates.
    3. The route's own ``_is_local_request``: the ``/api/shutdown``
       handler 403s non-localhost callers. Setting ``TRUST_PROXY=1`` plus
       a ``X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`` header makes ``get_client_ip``
       resolve to localhost without hard-coding test plumbing into prod.

    Sprint 15 / v32 Phase B defence-in-depth: ``os._exit`` is patched
    inside this fixture so a regression where a test arms the
    threading.Timer watchdog and forgets to cancel it cannot kill the
    pytest process partway through the suite (we hit exactly that
    failure during v32 fixture porting; see
    ``_v32_biz/_phase_b_watchdog_redesign.md``).
