"""SupervisorBrain adapter scaffolding for the v2 dispatch path.

The real Phase-2 brain rewrite is reserved for P-RC-4. Until then,
the v2 dispatch path needs *something* that satisfies the
:class:`openakita.runtime.supervisor.SupervisorBrain` protocol so
``Supervisor.run`` can be exercised end-to-end.

This module ships two implementations:

* :class:`DegenerateSupervisorBrain` -- the original canary brain
  that reports ``is_request_satisfied = True`` on the first
  progress-ledger call, so the supervisor terminates DONE on turn 1
  without delegating. Used by tests + the previous IM canary that
  pre-dates real delegation.
* :class:`PassThroughSupervisorBrain` -- single-delegation brain.
  Turn 1 emits ``next_speaker=<root_node_id>`` so the supervisor
  hands the verbatim user task to the root node via the injected
  ``deliver`` callable. Turn 2 observes the resulting
  :class:`DelegationResult` in ``history`` and emits
  ``is_request_satisfied=True``. Semantic equivalent of the previous
  ``OrgCommandService._run_minimal`` single-shot dispatch: the node
  still owns multi-step orchestration internally via Sprint-4
  ``<dispatch>`` XML parsing inside
  :class:`~openakita.orgs._runtime_agent_pipeline_executor.AgentPipelineExecutor.dispatch_subtask`
  recursion -- the brain does not need to plan multi-turn LLM calls.
  This is the production brain for the HTTP takeover path (Sprint-9).

A real multi-turn LLM-driven brain is the P-RC-4 follow-up; this
stays minimal so the HTTP takeover commit does not bundle a brain
rewrite.
