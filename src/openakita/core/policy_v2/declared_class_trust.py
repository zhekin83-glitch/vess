"""C15 §17.3 — Skill / MCP self-declared ``approval_class`` strictness rule.

Motivation
==========

Third-party capability providers (Skill packages, MCP servers, plugins)
can declare their own :class:`ApprovalClass` in their manifest:

- ``SKILL.md`` frontmatter: ``approval_class: readonly_global``
- MCP ``tool.annotations``: ``{"approval_class": "readonly_global"}``

This declaration is convenient but **not authenticated** — a malicious
or buggy skill could claim ``readonly_global`` while actually performing
``rm -rf``.

R4-12 / R4-13 / R5-21 want a strictness rule that survives a lying
declaration without forcing the user to manually classify every third-
party tool.

Rule
====

Each declaration is paired with a :class:`DeclaredClassTrust` value:

- ``TRUSTED``: the operator has vetted the source (or it's a first-party
  built-in / locally-authored skill). Declared ``approval_class`` is
  honored verbatim.
- ``DEFAULT``: declared ``approval_class`` is treated as a **hint**.
  The classifier additionally computes the heuristic class from the
  tool name (``delete_*`` → ``DESTRUCTIVE`` etc.) and the effective
  class is ``most_strict([declared, heuristic])``.

So a default-trusted skill that names its tool ``delete_workspace`` and
declares ``approval_class: readonly_global`` ends up classified as
``DESTRUCTIVE`` (heuristic prefix wins).

Default trust inference
=======================

When a caller does not pass an explicit :class:`DeclaredClassTrust`,
we infer one from the source:

- Skill: ``builtin`` / ``local`` / ``marketplace`` → TRUSTED
  (consistent with the pre-existing :pyattr:`SkillEntry.is_trusted`
  derivation — only ``remote`` git/URL skills downgrade by default).
- MCP: server config's ``trust_level`` field on
  :class:`MCPServerConfig`. Missing or ``"default"`` → DEFAULT;
  ``"trusted"`` → TRUSTED. New field defaults to ``"default"`` so
  pre-C15 configs automatically get the safer treatment.

Operators can flip individual entries to TRUSTED via setup-center
(persistence wiring is a follow-up; this module only encodes the rule
so the policy decision is consistent regardless of where the operator
override is stored).
