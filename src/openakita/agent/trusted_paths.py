"""Session/workspace trusted-path policy (Fix-11).

Reduces risk-gate friction for two common, low-risk situations without
loosening the high-risk path itself:

1. **Built-in trusted patterns** — the user explicitly created a scratch
   directory inside the current workspace (e.g. ``qa_test_2026_05_02``,
   ``workspaces/<ws>/scratch/...``, ``/tmp/...``). Edits/deletes inside these
   paths surface every time as MEDIUM-risk confirmations even though the
   user is the one who told us to create them. We treat such single-message
   intents as already authorised.

2. **Session-scoped manual grant** — the ``ask_user`` confirmation popup
   exposes a "本次会话内 workspace 内的同类操作不再询问" checkbox. The
   backend persists the choice in session metadata so subsequent in-session
   file ops in the same workspace skip the gate.

Design constraints (intentionally conservative):

- NEVER demote ``RiskLevel.HIGH`` (sensitive targets like death-switch /
  security policy / shell hard verbs still require confirmation).
- NEVER grant cross-session authority — every grant is scoped to the
  session metadata and to either an operation kind or a path pattern.
- NEVER auto-extend the grant; expiry is opt-in by the caller.
