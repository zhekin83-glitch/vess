"""Conversation-state guards.

These post-Decision validators decide whether the engine should
keep running tools or hand back to the user.

* :func:`looks_like_waiting_for_user_response` -- whether a final
  answer is a genuine user-handoff (需要你/请手动/浏览器被关闭)
  rather than a task promise; the completion-verification path
  uses this to avoid pushing back into tool execution after the
  model already reported a blocker.
* :func:`has_recoverable_tool_issue` -- whether the latest blocker
  is a tool-call shape issue the model can repair (unknown tool,
  required argument missing) versus a hard user blocker (browser
  closed, captcha, permission denied).

The four supporting word-list tuples (``USER_BLOCKED_MARKERS``,
``USER_BLOCKED_ACTIONS``, ``RECOVERABLE_TOOL_ERROR_MARKERS``,
``HARD_USER_BLOCKER_TOOL_MARKERS``) are kept beside the guards.
