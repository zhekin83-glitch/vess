"""Lightweight tests for ``seedance_inline.system_deps`` — the FFmpeg
detector + installer that the Settings page renders.

These cover the two real-world bugs the user just hit:

1. ``winget uninstall`` silently no-op'd because the command was missing
   ``--accept-source-agreements`` — it returned rc=0 but the file was
   still there, so detect() reported "uninstall failed: still installed".
2. The ``estimated_seconds`` / argv plumbing must stay in sync between
   install and uninstall recipes so the public dict the UI consumes does
   not desync.

We avoid spawning real winget / brew / apt — these tests only assert
the *shape* of the recipes and the post-op retry logic shape.  Running
the actual subprocess is intentionally out of scope (the dep installer
is an OS-side integration that needs a manual smoke test on each
platform anyway).
