"""
L3 Integration Tests: pyproject.toml wheel-packaging configuration.

These tests assert that the identity templates the setup wizard expects
to find under the installed ``openakita`` package directory are actually
shipped into the wheel via ``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]``.

Why this matters
================
``setup.wizard._resolve_identity_template`` has two resolution strategies:

1. Walk up from the running ``openakita`` package directory looking for a
   sibling ``identity/`` (the repo-checkout / ``pip install -e .`` path).
2. Fall back to ``<openakita-package-root>/identity/<file>`` (the
   wheel-install path, populated by hatch's force-include block).

If the wheel does not actually carry the identity templates, strategy (2)
silently fails and wheel-installed users end up with an empty ``SOUL.md``
plus a 5-line ``_STATIC_FALLBACKS['identity_core']`` prompt instead of the
full templated SOUL document.

This file pins the contract by parsing the project's ``pyproject.toml``
directly (no need to actually build a wheel) and asserting that the
relevant ``force-include`` entries exist, point at files that are present
in the source tree, and place those files under the expected
``openakita/identity/`` subtree.
