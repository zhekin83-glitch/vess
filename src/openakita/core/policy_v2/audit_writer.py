"""C22 P3-2: async batch audit writer.

Plan §13.5.2 A
==============

Plan §13.5.2 A spec'd an asyncio.Queue-based audit writer that decouples
the (latency-sensitive) policy decision path from the (slower) chained
file write:

    Producer (sync, hot path)
       │  enqueue(record)            ← non-blocking, µs-level
       ▼
    asyncio.Queue (bounded)
       │
       ▼
    Background async worker
       │  await queue.get(N records, or up to T ms)
       │  ChainedJsonlWriter.append_batch(records)   ← single filelock acq
       ▼
    On-disk audit JSONL (chain integrity preserved)

Without this, every ``AuditLogger.log()`` call in ``tool_executor`` paid
the filelock acquisition + tail-read cost on the engine hot path
(~1-2 ms per audit row on healthy disk, worse under contention).

Design constraints
==================

1. **Chain integrity is non-negotiable**. We delegate the actual append
   to :meth:`ChainedJsonlWriter.append_batch` which holds the same
   process+file lock semantics. Reordering inside a batch is forbidden
   — the worker drains the queue in FIFO order and passes records to
   ``append_batch`` in that exact order.

2. **At-least-once on graceful shutdown**. ``stop()`` drains the queue
   and awaits the worker. Records still in the queue when the
   interpreter crashes WITHOUT calling ``stop()`` are lost — that's a
   conscious tradeoff: blocking the hot path on sync flushes would
   undo the win. Operators who need at-most-once persistence for every
   row should disable the async writer (``audit.async_batch=false``)
   and pay the per-call cost.

3. **Backpressure → sync fallback**. When the bounded queue is full
   (producer outpacing worker, e.g. disk hiccup), ``enqueue()`` falls
   back to a direct ``ChainedJsonlWriter.append()`` call rather than
   dropping the record. This trades latency for correctness — losing
   audit rows would void the legal/compliance use of the chain.

4. **Thread safety across sync producers**. Producers run on whatever
   thread happens to call ``AuditLogger.log()`` (FastAPI worker
   threads, gateway streaming task, sync CLI invocations). The writer
   uses ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` to hand records to the queue
   from any thread.

5. **Lifecycle hooks**. ``start(loop)`` is idempotent; ``stop()`` is
   safe to call multiple times. ``is_running()`` lets callers fall
   back to sync writes when no worker is up (CLI mode, test fixtures).

Out of scope
============

- **Cross-process queue**. Each process has its own queue; the
  ``ChainedJsonlWriter`` filelock still serializes the actual file
  writes, so two processes both running async writers won't corrupt
  the chain — they'll just contend on the filelock as before, just
  with their workers (not their hot paths) waiting.

- **Persistence of in-flight queue across restart**. Out of scope per
  plan §13.5.2 A's tradeoff statement. If you need that, switch to
  ``audit.async_batch=false``.
