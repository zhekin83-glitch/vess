"""SEC EDGAR filings — public Atom feed with contact-UA compliance.

The SEC publishes the ``getcurrent`` Atom feed at a stable URL, but it
enforces its `Accessing EDGAR Data` rules strictly: any request whose
``User-Agent`` does not include a contact e-mail is rejected with a
``403 Forbidden``. We therefore *override* the shared Chrome UA here
via ``make_client(user_agent=...)`` rather than just appending an
``extra_headers`` banner — the previous attempt only added headers, so
the Chrome UA was still the one SEC saw, and every fetch came back as
``auth`` errors in the drawer.
