# OpenAkita Backend Revamp — Status

This document is the authoritative ledger of what the v2 fork-style
rewrite has shipped, what is in flight, and what every next session
should pick up. It complements the plan file
(`openakita_full_backend_revamp_e6d8610d.plan.md`) and the ADRs under
`docs/adr/`.

Branch: `revamp/v2` (forked from `main`).
ADR sign-off gate: **G0 signed — all 10 ADRs Accepted at G-RC-8 (2026-05-19).**
See `docs/adr/0001-...md`..`docs/adr/0010-...md`; original Proposed status flip was deferred until P-RC-0..P-RC-7 had shipped real implementations against each ADR.

## P-RC-9 -- orgs/ integral migration (LIVE on revamp/v3-orgs)

The deferred work the P8.4 pointer describes is now **actively
planned** on its own branch ``revamp/v3-orgs`` (forked from the
``v2.0.0-rc2`` tag at commit ``594d5cb1``). P-RC-9 keeps its
own paperwork separate from the P-RC-0..8 history that produced
the v2.0.0-rc2 release:

* Branch: ``revamp/v3-orgs`` (not pushed; ``revamp/v2`` and the
  ``v2.0.0-rc1`` / ``v2.0.0-rc2`` tags remain untouched).
* Ledger: [docs/revamp/PROGRESS_LEDGER_P9.md](PROGRESS_LEDGER_P9.md)
  (separate from the main ``PROGRESS_LEDGER.md`` so the two
  histories diff cleanly).
* Recon: [docs/revamp/P-RC-9-RECON.md](P-RC-9-RECON.md) (read-only
  analysis of the 26-file ``orgs/`` package, the 86 production
  callers, the 89-endpoint v1 REST surface, and the 6 v2
  subsystems the charter mandates).
* Plan: [docs/revamp/P-RC-9-PLAN.md](P-RC-9-PLAN.md) (P9.0..P9.10
  phase decomposition with LOC budgets and gate criteria).
* ADRs: ADR-0011 (subsystem decomposition), ADR-0012 (orgs/
  deletion strategy), ADR-0013 (wall-clock SLA tests).
* Mini-gate: each phase has its own ``G-RC-9.x.md`` review
  before the next phase opens; the full ``G-RC-9.md`` gate
  signs the v2.0.0-rc3 release after P9.10.

The original P-RC-9 deferred-work pointer below remains in place
because operators running v2.0.0-rc2 today still pull from
``revamp/v2`` and the legacy ``orgs/`` package is what their
deployment uses until P-RC-9 lands.

> **P-RC-9 deferred-work pointer (added at P8.4):** the wholesale ``src/openakita/orgs/`` integral migration the original plan section 8 implied is **not** executed in the continuation plan. See ``docs/revamp/P-RC-9-CHARTER.md`` for scope, estimate (4-6 weeks, ~30-50 commits, separate parity harness), and the six v2 subsystems (OrgManager / OrgRuntime / OrgCommandService / OrgBlackboard / ProjectStore / NodeScheduler) that must be written before ``orgs/`` can be deleted cleanly. Operators running v2 in production keep the legacy ``orgs/`` surface live until P-RC-9 lands.

Total to date: **95+ code/docs commits on `revamp/v2`**, all
lint-clean (ruff over the v2 surface), test-green (755 / 755 + 1
skipped across `tests/runtime/`, `tests/agent/`, `tests/api/`,
`tests/unit/test_plugins/`, `tests/parity/`). Parity harness
maintains 30 / 30 cases at 100 % pass rate.

**v2.0.0-rc1 is tagged locally.** Phase 0 → 7 fully delivered; Phase
8 RC scope (release notes + safe single deletion +
G8 paperwork + tag) shipped. The mechanical removal of legacy
``orgs/`` and the ``core/`` shims is the post-RC engineering cycle,
gated by the burn-in described in ``docs/revamp/burn_in.md``.

### 2026-05-18 mid-cycle plan-vs-reality review

`docs/revamp/PLAN_AUDIT.md` records a full audit of what shipped vs
what the plan called for, and the recovery order. Two of the four
P0 items the audit identified were closed in this cycle:

* `plugins/manager.py` now discovers the v2 ``WORKBENCH`` manifest at
  load time (the loader-side half of ADR-0009 was previously unbuilt).
* `runtime/state_graph.py` lands as the Pregel-style routing engine
  ``ConditionNode.next_address`` was always meant to feed.

Both unblock G3/G4 sign-off. The remaining caveats are paperwork
(gate review notes) and the Phase 2 giant rewrite, which is now
fully scoped by `docs/revamp/core_audit.md` (the audit the plan §8
mandated at Phase 2 entry; previously missing).

## P-RC-10 -- ``runtime/`` hygiene flattening (DEFERRED; charter only)

P-RC-9 plan section 7 Q-A accepts default (a) "keep
``runtime/orgs/`` under ``runtime/`` for now" -- which formally
defers the ``runtime/`` wholesale flattening that becomes
attractive once v1 is dead. ``docs/revamp/P-RC-10-CHARTER.md``
captures the scope, three-category split (A keep / B fold to
``agent/`` / C case-by-case), trigger conditions, and the
v2.1.0 release relationship.

* Status: NOT executed. Charter only -- no source moves yet.
* Trigger: P-RC-9 fully shipped + ``v2.0.0-rc3`` stable >= 1
  week + G-RC-9 audit PASS + ACCEPTANCE 5/5 + (recommended)
  ``v2.0.0`` merged + tagged.
* Scope: 9-10 sub-moves, 15-25 commits, 1-2 weeks one
  engineer. Pattern: physical ``git mv`` + import redirect, no
  shim (no v1 around to confuse).
* Future ADR: ADR-0014 (added at P-RC-10.0) will warn plugin
  authors that paths under ``runtime/{llm,io,context,desktop,
  guardrail}`` move in v2.1.0.

The charter exists for the same reason ``P-RC-9-CHARTER.md``
existed during the P-RC-8 closeout: so the next agent picking
up the work after the v2.0.0 release does not have to
re-discover the scope or the rationale.


## What v2 already delivers

The dual-ledger orchestration that ADR-0004 promises is end-to-end
working at module level:

```
TaskLedger (outer)               StallDetector
        │                                │

        │                                                          OUT_OF_TURNS)
        ├── stream events:    progress_ledger / checkpoints / lifecycle / tasks / updates
        ├── checkpoints:      after every turn, on accepted deliverable, on cancel
        ├── cancel:           cooperative via CancellationToken, writes a final ckpt
        └── delegate:         Messenger.deliver(speaker, instruction, ...) ──► node
                                                                        │
                                                                        ▼
                                                              GuardrailRunner.evaluate()
                                                              (OK | RETRY | HARD_FAIL)
```

The duplicate-storyboard regression (the headline pain in the user's
original report) cannot reproduce in v2 because:

1. wall-clock cancels are no longer in the loop (`max_task_seconds`
   has no v2 equivalent in the supervisor's decision path);
2. when a long step is *progressing*, the LLM says
   `is_progress_being_made=true` and the stall counter regenerates;
3. when a step actually stalls, the supervisor *replans* with new
   facts and a new plan — it does not cancel and re-delegate the same
   sub-task to the same node;
4. cancellations save a final checkpoint so resume is exact.

`tests/runtime/test_stall_detector.py::test_regression_long_progressing_storyboard_does_not_replan`
encodes the regression test for this.

## What is *not* shipped yet (continuation map)

Each entry below names the module, its ADR, the legacy file it
replaces (with line count), and the rough effort.

### Phase 2 — Agent core, remaining slices

The agent's leaf modules above the Phase-1 foundation. Each is one
focused commit with tests. Already done:

| Module | ADR | Replaces | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent/state.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/agent_state.py` | **Done.** Phase-1 era port; 17 tests. |
| `agent/errors.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/errors.py` | **Done.** Move with re-export shim; 4 tests. |
| `agent/working_facts.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/working_facts.py` | **Done.** Move with re-export shim; 11 tests. |
| `agent/output_guard.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/agent_output_guard.py` | **Done.** Move with re-export shim; 14 tests. |
| `agent/output_formatter.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/output_formatter.py` | **Done.** Move with re-export shim; 14 tests. |
| `agent/identity.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/identity.py` | **Done.** Byte-equivalent move with docstring refresh; legacy `tests/unit/test_identity.py` (17 tests) keeps passing via shim. |

Remaining:

| Module | ADR | Replaces | Legacy lines | Cap (lines) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agent/permission.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/permission.py` | 455 | 250 |
| `agent/audit.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/audit_logger.py` | 177 | 150 |
| `agent/prompt.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/prompt_assembler.py` | 157 | 200 |
| `agent/context.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/context_manager.py` | 1 569 | 400 |
| `agent/tools.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/tool_executor.py` | 1 609 | 300 |
| `agent/brain.py` | ADR-0003 | `core/brain.py` | 1 698 | 400 |
| **`agent/reasoning.py`** | ADR-0003 | `core/reasoning_engine.py` | **7 987** | **600** |
| **`agent/core.py`** | ADR-0003 | `core/agent.py` | **8 433** | **500** |
| `agent/facade.py` | ADR-0003 | n/a | 0 | 100 |

The two big ones (`reasoning.py` and `core.py`) need a parity harness
under `tests/parity/` that runs identical inputs through the legacy
and the v2 paths. The plan reserves Phase 2 (W6-10) for this; expect
the v2 reasoning loop to be implemented as a state graph driven by
`runtime/state_graph.py` (still pending — see Phase 3 below) so the
full loop body fits in `reasoning.py`.

### Phase 3 — Runtime engine (delivered)

| Module | ADR | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `runtime/state_graph.py` | ADR-0002 + ADR-0007 | **Done.** Pregel-style ``StateGraph`` with ``add_node`` / ``add_edge`` / ``add_conditional_edges`` / ``set_entry_point`` / ``validate``. ``route()`` resolves in priority conditional > static > delegation hint > defer-to-supervisor; unknown branch labels raise loudly. ``compile_from_org`` projects an OrgV2 into the graph (HIERARCHY/COLLABORATE → static, CONSULT dropped). 28 tests. The supervisor's deliver path will plug in here in Phase 6 as part of the channels-gateway swap. |

### Phase 4 — Nodes (delivered)

| Module | ADR | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `runtime/nodes/base.py` | ADR-0007 | **Done.** NodeProtocol + NodeContext + BaseNode (lifecycle state machine, defensive exception promotion, cooperative cancel routing). 13 tests. |
| `runtime/nodes/tool_node.py` | ADR-0007 | **Done.** Single-tool step with documented JSON / metadata argument parsing. 8 tests. |
| `runtime/nodes/llm_node.py` | ADR-0007 | **Done.** Brain-driven node with bounded ReAct tool loop, allow-list rejection, budget guard, runner-absent recovery. 8 tests. |
| `runtime/nodes/condition_node.py` | ADR-0007 | **Done.** Deterministic sync/async predicate routing with construction-time validation; deterministic failure on unknown / non-string labels. 8 tests. |
| `runtime/nodes/human_review_node.py` | ADR-0007 | **Done.** Three-verdict (APPROVE/REJECT/EDIT) review pause with cooperative cancel cleanup and InMemoryReviewQueue reference. 9 tests. |
| `runtime/nodes/manifest.py` | ADR-0009 | **Done.** WorkbenchManifest / WorkbenchMode / WorkbenchUI dataclasses + `parse(raw_dict)` validator. 14 tests. |
| `runtime/nodes/workbench_node.py` | ADR-0007 + ADR-0009 | **Done.** Plugin-as-node with mode-scoped tool allow-list, explicit mode switching, workbench_ready / workbench_mode_switched / workbench_cancelled lifecycle envelope. 9 tests. |
| `plugins/happyhorse-video/plugin.py` (`WORKBENCH` constant) | ADR-0009 | **Done.** Four-role manifest (art_director / image_artist / video_animator / portrait_actor) + load-time validation in `tests/test_workbench_manifest.py`. |

G4 is now substantively complete: the state graph (the previously
missing piece behind ``ConditionNode.next_address``) is shipped,
and ``plugins/manager.py`` parses the ``WORKBENCH`` manifest at
plugin load (so live plugins self-describe their workbench, not
just templates that hand-build a manifest). Remaining for G4
sign-off is the written gate review note under
``docs/revamp/gates/G4.md`` — paperwork.

### Phase 5 — Templates (delivered)

| Module | ADR | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `runtime/templates/schema.py` | ADR-0008 | **Done.** TemplateSpec / NodeSpec / EdgeSpec / DefaultsSpec / GuardrailSpec / WorkbenchBindingSpec / NodeRuntimeOverridesSpec dataclasses with construction-time `validate()` and JSON round-trip. 25 tests. |
| `runtime/templates/registry.py` | ADR-0008 | **Done.** @template decorator (lazy queue), TemplateRegistry (register / get / list / clear / bootstrap), `instantiate(template_id, name=, overrides=)` mints fresh `OrgV2` with prefixed ULIDs and applies a closed override whitelist (`defaults`, `node_persona_prompts`, `node_runtime_overrides`); unknown override keys raise loudly. **2026-05-18 fix:** `instantiate` now also derives `NodeV2.parent_id` from `EdgeKind.HIERARCHY` edges so `OrgV2.root_nodes()` and `children_of()` return real trees (previously every node looked like a root); multi-parent HIERARCHY raises `TemplateValidationError`, repeat-edges are idempotent. `discover_builtins()` auto-imports `runtime.templates.builtin.*`. 21 tests (16 + 5 parent-id regression). |
| `runtime/templates/builtin/aigc_video_studio.py` | ADR-0008 + ADR-0009 | **Done.** 7-node AIGC studio: producer → screenwriter / art_director → wb_image / wb_video / wb_human / wb_long; four workbench leaves bound to the `happyhorse-video` manifest, with the stitching node narrowed to `(storyboard, long_video, video_concat)` capabilities. Personas Chinese, ~190 lines vs the legacy ~420-line dict. 12 tests. |
| `runtime/templates/builtin/software_team.py` | ADR-0008 | **Done.** 10-node engineering org with HIERARCHY / COLLABORATE / CONSULT edges (qa→leads as CONSULT). 7 tests. |
| `runtime/templates/builtin/startup_company.py` | ADR-0008 | **Done.** 16-node generic startup with four C-level departments and four cross-department COLLABORATE edges. 6 tests. |
| `runtime/templates/builtin/content_ops.py` | ADR-0008 | **Done.** 7-node editorial team with the data-loop COLLABORATE edge from data_analyst → planner. 6 tests. |
| `tests/runtime/templates/test_builtin_discovery.py` | ADR-0008 | **Done.** Generic guard: `discover_builtins` imports every non-underscore module under `builtin/`, every registered TemplateSpec validates and instantiates, and the four flagship template ids are present. |

The legacy `orgs/templates.py` (1 234 lines) and
`orgs/plugin_workbench_templates.py` (225 lines) are deleted in
Phase 8 once the API surface in Phase 6 is wired to the v2
registry. The Phase 6 facade should call::

    from openakita.runtime.templates import discover_builtins, GLOBAL_REGISTRY
    discover_builtins()
    GLOBAL_REGISTRY.bootstrap()

once at startup and serve `GLOBAL_REGISTRY.list()` from
`/api/orgs/templates`.

### Phase 6 — API / channels swap

| Slice | Status |
|---|---|
| `src/openakita/api/routes/orgs_v2.py` (template facade) | **Done.** ``GET /api/v2/orgs/templates`` (list), ``GET /api/v2/orgs/templates/{id}`` (one), ``POST /api/v2/orgs/templates/{id}/instantiate`` (mint a fresh OrgV2). Gated by ``settings.runtime_v2_enabled``. 15 tests. |
| `runtime/templates/registry.py` survivable factory marker | **Done.** ``@template`` now also sets ``__openakita_template_factory__`` on the function so :func:`collect_builtin_factories` can repopulate the registry without depending on the lazy ``_PENDING`` queue (which test fixtures sometimes drain). 3 new tests. |
| `api/server.py` mount | **Done.** Router included after the v1 ``orgs`` routers. Always mounted; per-request flag check decides whether to serve. |
| `runtime/api/v2/orgs/{id}` resource (CRUD) | Pending (Phase 7 also persists). |
| `src/openakita/channels/gateway.py` per-org v2 route | Pending. |
| `apps/setup-center/src/components/OrgChatPanel.tsx` v2 stream | Pending. |

### Phase 7 — Cutover

`scripts/migrate_orgs_to_legacy.py` (ADR-0010) plus
`runtime.facade.bootstrap_builtins()` for the fresh-start data
policy. 7-day burn-in is not gated by code; it is a runbook step.

### Phase 8 — Legacy removal

Mechanical `git rm` of `src/openakita/orgs/` and the rewritten
`src/openakita/core/*.py` files. One commit per concern so a `git
log` reader can diff the world before / after.

## How to resume in the next session

1. Read this `STATUS.md` first, then `docs/revamp/RELEASE_v2.md` for
   the v2.0.0-rc1 release notes (Phase 0 → 8 RC scope) and
   `docs/revamp/burn_in.md` for the operator runbook.
2. **All eight phases of the original plan have shipped at RC
   scope.** The local `v2.0.0-rc1` tag marks the milestone.
3. **Post-RC mechanical cleanup checklist** (gated by the burn-in
   exit criteria in `burn_in.md`):
   * Migrate ~20 production callers (channels gateway, api routes,
     agents.factory, orgs runtime/command_service/tool_handler) from
     `openakita.orgs.*` to `runtime.orgs` + `runtime.state_graph`,
     then `git rm -r src/openakita/orgs/` and the ~50
     `tests/orgs/*` files.
   * Migrate ~20 callers in `sessions/` / `memory/` / `tools/` /
     `agents/` from `openakita.core.*` MOVE shims to
     `openakita.agent.*`, then delete the shims.
   * Deep slim refactor of the five REWRITE targets — each its own
     chain (extract streaming into `runtime/stream/`, collapse
     routing/retry into `runtime.retry_policy`, drive reasoning by
     `runtime.state_graph`, split `agent.core` helpers into
     `runtime/desktop/` + `agent/safety/`).
   * Optional rename `core/task_monitor.py` → `runtime/standup.py`
     once the importer set is small enough.
4. Always:
   * one logical change per commit, English commit body, mention
     the relevant ADR;
   * `python -m pytest tests/runtime tests/agent tests/api
     tests/unit/test_plugins tests/parity --no-header -q`
     before every commit (must keep 755 + 1 skipped green);
   * `python -m ruff check src/openakita/runtime src/openakita/agent
     src/openakita/plugins/manager.py tests/runtime tests/agent
     tests/api tests/parity` before every commit.
5. Never edit the plan file or the ADR `Status:` lines without a
   user-led review.

## How to *use* what already exists today

Even before Phases 4-7 land, the v2 supervisor stack is usable for
small experiments:

```python
import asyncio
from openakita.runtime.checkpoint import MemoryCheckpointer
from openakita.runtime.stream import StreamBus
from openakita.runtime.supervisor import Supervisor, DelegationResult
from openakita.runtime.messenger import Messenger, InMemoryNodeRegistry

# 1. Define a fake brain that satisfies SupervisorBrain.
# 2. Register a node on an InMemoryNodeRegistry.
# 3. messenger.bind_for_command(...) gives you the deliver callable.
# 4. Pass everything into Supervisor and call await sup.run().
```

The integration test in `tests/runtime/test_supervisor.py` is the
canonical wiring example; copy it as a starting point.
