"""tests/api/test_server_app_wiring.py

Regression guard for **F-1** (P-RC-9 post-closure smoke; round RT001).

P-RC-9 P9.6 made ``OrgRuntime.__init__`` keyword-only with three required
``Protocol`` parameters (``lookup`` / ``persistence`` / ``lifecycle_emitter``).
P-RC-9 P9.4 made ``OrgCommandService.__init__`` keyword-only after the
leading ``runtime`` arg.  The composition root in ``api/server.py`` was
left on the v1 positional call convention, which made ``openakita serve``
fail with ``TypeError`` at app construction.

This test asserts that:
1. ``create_app()`` succeeds with all-default arguments.
2. ``app.state.org_runtime`` is an ``OrgRuntime`` instance.
3. ``app.state.org_command_service`` is an ``OrgCommandService`` instance.
4. The runtime's wired ``lookup`` / ``persistence`` / ``lifecycle_emitter``
   match the OrgManager-owned siblings (composition-root invariant).
