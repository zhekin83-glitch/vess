"""avatar-studio — DashScope digital human studio (Phase 4 wiring).

Backend entry point. Wires:

- ``AvatarTaskManager``  — sqlite3-backed CRUD for tasks / voices / figures.
- ``AvatarDashScopeClient`` — DashScope async client (hot reload via
  ``read_settings`` callable).
- ``run_pipeline``        — 8-step linear orchestrator, spawned per task as a
  background ``asyncio.Task`` via ``api.spawn_task``.
- ``add_upload_preview_route`` — vendored upload preview helper (issue #479).

Routes (24):

  Tasks      POST /tasks            POST /cost-preview
             GET  /tasks            POST /tasks/{id}/cancel
             GET  /tasks/{id}       POST /tasks/{id}/retry
             DELETE /tasks/{id}
  Voices     GET  /voices           POST /voices
             POST /voices/{id}/rename
             DELETE /voices/{id}    POST /voices/{id}/sample
  Figures    GET  /figures          POST /figures
             DELETE /figures/{id}
  System     GET  /settings         PUT  /settings   GET /healthz
             POST /test-connection  POST /capabilities/probe
             POST /cleanup
  Upload     POST /upload           GET  /uploads/{rel_path:path}
  Catalog    GET  /catalog          GET  /prompt-guide
  AI Helper  POST /ai/compose-prompt

Pixelle hardening
-----------------

- C5  Missing API key on ``on_load`` is a WARN (red dot in UI), not a raise.
- C6  Pydantic models reject unknown fields with a 422 + ``ignored`` list.
- A10 ``read_settings`` callable threaded into the DashScope client; PUT
       /settings calls ``client.update_api_key`` for the immediate path.
- C3  ``api.broadcast_ui_event`` is the SSE channel; pipeline ``emit``
       wraps it.
