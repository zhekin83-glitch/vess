"""Path template placeholder resolution (single source of truth).

Before this module existed, three different call-sites each had their own
"expand ``${CWD}`` / ``~``" logic with subtly different behaviour:

- ``schema.PolicyConfigV2.expand_placeholders`` used **strict equality**
  ``if p == "${CWD}"``, which meant ``"${CWD}/secrets/**"`` was **silently
  not expanded** and entered the engine as the literal string. Prefix-
  matching in ``_check_safety_immune`` against real absolute paths would
  then never hit, so user-defined ``safety_immune.paths`` containing
  ``${CWD}/...`` were a **silent no-op**. This was a real security hole.
- ``safety_immune_defaults.expand_builtin_immune_paths`` correctly used
  ``replace("${CWD}", ...)`` and so worked for the built-in 9 categories.

Centralising here:

- One canonical resolver shared by ``schema.expand_placeholders`` and
  ``safety_immune_defaults.expand_builtin_immune_paths``.
- Future placeholders (``${HOME}`` / ``${WORKSPACE}``) plug in here.
- Windows path normalisation (backslash → forward slash) lives in one
  place.

Supported placeholders
======================

- ``${CWD}`` — current working directory; resolved via the explicit
  ``cwd`` argument (engine init time) or ``Path.cwd()`` as last resort.
- ``${HOME}`` — user's home directory; alias for ``~`` so users can pick
  whichever syntax they prefer.
- ``${WORKSPACE}`` — reserved for setup-center's workspace concept
  (distinct from process CWD). When the ``workspace`` argument is
  ``None`` we fall back to ``cwd`` so existing configs keep working.
- ``~`` / ``~/`` prefix — handled via ``Path.expanduser``.

Order matters: ``~`` is detected first (must be a prefix); then
``${HOME}`` / ``${CWD}`` / ``${WORKSPACE}`` are substituted anywhere in
the string via ``.replace()``. This handles both ``"${CWD}"`` (exact
match) and ``"${CWD}/sub/path"`` correctly — that's the bug fix.

Outputs use forward slashes regardless of platform so downstream prefix-
match logic (e.g. ``_path_under``) doesn't need to special-case ``\\``
vs ``/``.
