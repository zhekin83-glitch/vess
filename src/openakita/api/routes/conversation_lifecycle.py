"""Centralized conversation lifecycle manager.

Manages busy-lock state transitions and ensures consistent cleanup across
all exit paths (normal completion, cancel, delete, disconnect).

Previously, busy-lock logic was scattered across chat.py (_mark_busy,
_clear_busy) and only released in _stream_chat's finally block, which
caused stale "in-progress" states when conversations were cancelled or
deleted through different code paths.

v1.27.14 (plan: conversation concurrency v1.28, S1.2):
- ``BusyInfo`` gained a ``turn_id`` field, populated when the request has
  a turn-level idempotency key (S1.6 TurnRegistry).
- ``start()`` returns a richer :class:`StartResult` that distinguishes
  same-client takeover (INTERRUPT/STEER) from different-client conflict
  (always REJECT) and carries the active :class:`DoubleTextingPolicy`.
- For backwards compatibility, :class:`StartResult` is iterable as the
  legacy ``(conflict, generation)`` tuple so older call-sites keep
  working without modification.  Callers are encouraged to read named
  attributes (``conflict``, ``generation``, ``took_over``,
  ``policy_applied``, ``queued_after_generation``).
