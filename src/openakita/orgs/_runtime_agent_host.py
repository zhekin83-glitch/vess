"""``_runtime_agent_host.py`` -- v2 orgs node-level tool execution host.

Sprint-6 P0-1 (audit ``_orgs_business_capability_audit_v6.md`` + RCA
``_v17_p1_rca.md`` §1.5): close the D4 tool-execution loop that
Sprint-5 left half-wired. The Sprint-5 commit (5960bf3e) routed
:func:`._runtime_node_tools.execute_node_tool` straight at
:data:`openakita.tools.handlers.default_handler_registry`, expecting
v1 to have populated that global with 20 system handlers. v17 audit
proved the assumption wrong: every ``register_handler(...)`` call in
the codebase points at **per-Agent** ``self.handler_registry`` (see
``core/_agent_runtime.py:1099-1101 + 2216-2285``); the global was an
empty :class:`SystemHandlerRegistry` lookup cache used by
``policy_v2`` for approval-class metadata only. Result: every D4
``execute_by_tool`` call raised ``ValueError: No handler mapped for
tool: <name>`` and the surrounding ``except Exception`` block silently
turned it into ``node_tool_failed`` -- 12/12 tool calls in v17 audit
were "failed" with the LLM seeing ``[tool xxx failed: ...]`` text and
hallucinating around it (audit §1.R.D4, 0 ``node_tool_completed``).

### Design (RCA §1.4 + §六 escape-hatch)

The RCA's recommendation (§1.5 method B) was "per-org Agent
instance, complete with file_tool / memory_manager / default_cwd".
That requires ~500 LOC and a careful import-cycle audit because the
v1 ``Agent`` constructor pulls in browser / MCP / scheduler / shell
managers we do not actually need for orgs_v2 nodes (RCA §1.5.4
risk). The user-supplied Worker prompt's escape hatch explicitly
allows the minimum-viable wrapper when full per-org instantiation is
risky:

    "如果 NodeToolHost 实施时发现 v1 chat handler_registry 注册路径
    强依赖 Agent 实例 / 工厂 state（即无法独立复制）→ 写明并提案
    '重构成 Builder 模式'作为下下 sprint 任务，本次用最小 wrapper
    兜底"

The handlers ARE tightly coupled to a full ``Agent`` instance
(``FilesystemHandler`` reads ``agent.default_cwd`` /
``agent._execution_env_spec``; ``MemoryHandler`` reads
``agent.memory_manager`` etc.). Re-instantiating a per-org ``Agent``
would either re-do all that work for a fake context or leave many
handlers in degraded mode. So Sprint-6 takes the wrapper path:

* :class:`NodeToolHost` is built **once per process** (or once per
  ``OrgRuntime`` instance) and re-uses the main desktop ``Agent``'s
  already-populated ``handler_registry`` + tool-definition list.
* All 20 system handlers (filesystem / memory / web_search /
  web_fetch / search / plan / scheduled / mcp / persona / sticker /
  notebook / config / lsp / sleep / mode / structured_output /
  agent_package / system / im_channel / code_quality / skills /
  profile) are reachable immediately.
* **Plugin tools (``hh_*`` etc.) come along for free**: the plugin
  API (``plugins/api.py:300``) registers plugin handlers into the
  same ``agent.handler_registry`` and extends ``agent._tools`` with
  their definitions, so a node that whitelists ``hh_image_create``
  in its ``external_tools`` will find both the definition (for the
  LLM tool list) and the handler (for execution) without any
  Sprint-6 plumbing changes. This closes Sprint-6 P0-3 in the same
  module (see :meth:`NodeToolHost.lookup_tool_definition`).
* The host falls back to the (empty) global registry / static
  definitions table when ``app.state.agent`` has not finished
  wiring -- old observable preserved for backwards compatibility
  with bootstrap-race smokes (RCA §1.5.4 rollback path).

### Out-of-scope for Sprint-6 (documented; do NOT add without audit sign-off)

* The handler registry still comes from the main Agent, but org node file
  calls are given an explicit per-command workspace by
  :mod:`openakita.orgs._runtime_node_tools`. They therefore do not inherit the
  main Agent's ``default_cwd`` when a path or search root is omitted.
* **Per-org memory scope** -- memory handler reads / writes via the
  shared ``memory_manager``. Tenant isolation is a Sprint-7 item;
  Sprint-6 ships with a TODO comment and an integration test that
  documents the shared-scope observable (no surprise behaviour for
  v18).
* **Multi-round ReAct** -- :data:`._runtime_node_tools.MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS`
  stays at 1 (Sprint-5 deliberate bound, RCA §1.5.3 out-of-scope #1).
* **Permission / approval gate** -- this Sprint routes through the
  registry's plain ``execute_by_tool`` without going through the
  full ``ToolExecutor`` (which would require an active session /
  user / approval channel; orgs_v2 nodes run unattended). A
  follow-up sprint will plug ``policy_v2`` gates in. The ``RCA``
  §1.5.4 "permission gate" risk is acknowledged here; for Sprint-6
  the orgs_v2 path stays consistent with Sprint-5's choice (no
  gate) and the changelog calls this out explicitly.

### When the host is unavailable

``execute_node_tool`` keeps its Sprint-5 fallback to
``default_handler_registry`` so headless test fixtures and the
lifespan-race window between FastAPI starting and the desktop
``Agent`` finishing wiring keep working. The fallback path will
still raise ``ValueError: No handler mapped`` (same as v17) but at
least no test code needs to change; production wiring (via
``api/server.py`` lifespan) installs a host before any user command
can dispatch.

    Construction is intentionally cheap: we only stash references to

    handler instantiation, no MCP / browser bring-up. The host's
    lifetime is bound to the ``OrgRuntime`` it was registered against
    (see :meth:`OrgRuntime.register_node_tool_host`); ``dispose``
    drops the references for a clean shutdown but does not tear down
    anything on the source agent.

    * :meth:`execute_tool` -- dispatch a tool call by name through
      the bound registry; mirrors
      ``SystemHandlerRegistry.execute_by_tool`` but with a clearer
      "tool unavailable" error so the orgs_v2 emit path can surface
      ``reason=plugin_not_loaded`` instead of the generic
      ``ValueError: No handler mapped...`` string the LLM had to
      hallucinate around in v17.
    * :meth:`lookup_tool_definition` -- find the Anthropic-shape tool
      dict for a tool name, scanning the main agent's ``_tools``
      list first (which includes plugin extensions) and falling
      back to the static ``tools/definitions/`` table. Returns
      ``None`` for unknown names so the resolver in
      ``_runtime_node_tools.resolve_node_tools`` can decide whether
      to drop the entry or surface a ``plugin_not_loaded`` warning.

      currently dispatch (used by the parity test against v1).
