"""openakita.relay.resolver — plugin-facing relay endpoint lookup.

Verifies the three contracts plugins rely on:

1. ``list_relay_endpoints`` only returns enabled relays by default
   (the user's toggle on the LLMView page MUST be honoured) and can
   be filtered by capability so a TTS plugin never sees an image
   relay.
2. ``resolve_relay_endpoint`` is case- and whitespace-insensitive on
   the lookup name; missing names raise RelayNotFound carrying the
   ``available`` list so the plugin can show "did you mean X?".
3. ``RelayReference.supports_model`` matches the LLM core
   ``EndpointConfig.supports_model`` behaviour bit-for-bit so the
   plugin layer's "grey out unsupported model" UI matches the LLM
   layer's eligibility filter.

The tests use real EndpointManager + real on-disk JSON in tmp_path
to make sure the full ``api_key_env`` -> .env lookup path works.
